        You are an expert in classifying CSR projects according to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
        Given the following project data, identify the most relevant SDG for each project.

        Each project contains the following details:
        - CSR Focus Area (e.g., education, health, environment, etc.)
        - Implementing Organisation (name of the organization implementing the project)
        - Project Type (Annual/Ongoing)
        - Implementation Status (whether the project is ongoing, under implementation, completed, etc.)
        - District (the district where the project is being implemented)
        - State (the state where the project is being implemented)
        - You should not insert any null values in the response.

        Please return the classification in strict JSON format with the following structure (nothing else should be included in the response, not even 'JSON' at the beginning, and do not include newline characters in the fields):

        [
            {{"implementing_organisation": "XYZ", "sdg_number": "1", "sdg_name": "No Poverty", "district": "District Name", "state": "State Name", "project_status": "Under Implementation", "project_type": "Ongoing"}},
            {{"implementing_organisation": "ABC", "sdg_number": "3", "sdg_name": "Good Health and Well-being", "district": "Another District", "state": "Another State", "project_status": "Completed", "project_type": "Annual"}}
